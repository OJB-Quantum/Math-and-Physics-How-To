### Pro Tips for Solving Mathematical Problems by (O.J.B.):

| **Tip** | **Explanation/ Details** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Substitute given variables with custom <br> or other existing variables (e.g., AbcdEfG) | Solve the equation using your own variables, then mirror the steps onto the original problem for proportional reasoning. A technique to solving a formula is to find a term that exists in a different equation, followed by solving for that desired term (isolating it to one side). |
| Interpret the equal sign as <br> "converts to" | Thinking of "=" as "converts to" can facilitate substitutions & <br> manipulations in other mathematical expressions. |
| Think in terms of ratios by <br> default | Viewing values as ratios can simplify problem-solving &  conceptual understanding. |
| Understand the difference between analytical vs. numerical approaches| Exact solutions are often associated with analytical approaches while approximation or discretized solutions are often associated with numerical appoaches. | 
| Isolating a term in a complex mathematical formula is like untangling a knot | Sometimes one needs to loosen things before making real progress, and every move must be made with careful consideration of how it affects the whole structure. Being well-organized & systematic can take one a very long way in problem solving. |
| Use software tools for conversion <br> to markdown or LaTeX | Convert equations for better inspection & rendering, ensuring <br> accuracy. |
| Leverage Python & libraries <br> like SymPy | Write equations in Python for execution & manipulation, aiding clarity & verification. |
| Remember solutions on graphs <br> are line intersections | Graphical solutions typically correspond to intersection points of lines or curves. |
| It is safe to assume invisible exponents of 1 as well as invisible grouping symbols | Keeping this in mind helps to maintain organization for obtaining a correct result. <br> It also helps with being able to linearize the writing format for code and things like LaTeX. |
| Use preferred mathematical <br> notations | Include curly brackets, e-notation, prime/dot notation, & highlight invisible symbols for clarity & precision. |
| Stay aware of term replacements | Recognize when terms are replaced or approximated in mathematical contexts. Keywords: replacement, approximation. |
| Consider various methods <br> (axiomatic, first principles, <br> empirical) | Use diverse approaches, including logical derivations, empirical evidence, & hybrid methodologies for problem-solving. |
| Explore graphical, tabulated, or <br> geometric representations | Visual or tabular methods can simplify complex mathematical concepts. |
| Practice final exam reviews | Mastery in mathematics comes with regular & extensive practice, particularly of exam-style problems. |

### Table of Useful General Assumptions for Abstract Terminology Used in Everyday Life:

| **Term or Concept** | **Description or Note** |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Another way of saying abstract** | “Indeterminate” or “boundless". |
| **Light** | Generally refers to the electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation. When quantized, it usually refers to photons but can also mean quantized modes, coherent and squeezed states, polaritons, or plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons. |
| **Optics** | A branch of physics concerned with the generation, propagation, manipulation, and detection of electromagnetic radiation (especially in and around the visible range), as well as its interactions with matter, including phenomena like reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, and polarization. There are sub-disciplines or sub-classifications of optics such as electron, ion, and quantum optics. |
| **Plastic** | Often used metaphorically to refer to something moldable or flexible; in a physical context, it can mean a polymer material or exhibit plastic (irreversible) deformation. |
| **Radiation** | The emission or transmission of energy through space or a medium in the form of electromagnetic waves (e.g., radio waves, visible light, X-rays, gamma rays) or subatomic particles (e.g., alpha, beta, neutrons). In a broader sense, it can also refer to acoustic waves, though in physics “radiation” typically implies electromagnetic or particle radiation. Many people equate “radiation” solely with ionizing radiation, which is harmful in large doses and includes X-rays, gamma rays, and high-energy particles that can ionize atoms. This is a common misunderstanding because non-ionizing radiation (like visible light, microwaves, radio waves) is also “radiation,” just not ionizing. |
| **Electric field** | Generally refers to the force per unit charge in a region due to a static or dynamic charge distribution. It can also be generated or excited by time-varying magnetic fields (as in electromagnetic waves) or by charge redistribution effects caused by incident radiation (e.g., in the photoelectric effect). Note: In formal treatments, the photoelectric effect is more often framed in a quantum context rather than purely classical terms. |
| **Pure electric fields can be justified as being “pure”** | If they originate from idealized situations: a point charge, a parallel plate capacitor, uniformly charged conductors, electrostatic lenses (vacuum tube-based focusing), and electric dipole fields. |
| **Space** | A boundless, continuous, or discrete extent in which objects, fields, or systems exist, interact, and have relative positions. In STEM, it can refer to **physical space** (three-dimensional Euclidean or non-Euclidean structures), **mathematical spaces** (vector spaces, phase spaces, Hilbert spaces, and even two-dimensional planes such as Cartesian planes or complex planes), or **conceptual spaces** (design spaces, information spaces). In everyday life, it denotes an area, room, or capacity for existence, movement, or thought. |
| **Platform(s)** | Can be a physical or conceptual foundation upon which systems, processes, or experiments are built. |
| **Linearity** | 1:1 ratio in the response by default, with a consistent or zero rate of change. |
| **Non-linearity** | Any relationship where the ratio or response exhibits a non-zero rate of change; not a simple 1:1 linear relationship. |
| **Theory** | Often confused with “hypothesis” or “mathematical justification.” In science, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world. |
| **Magnetic** | Refers to magnetism. By default, all matter made of atoms is at least diamagnetic. If it is not diamagnetic, its magnetism (paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.) depends on or is determined by the behavior of its electrons. When describing the spin direction of a single electron, it is referred to as the magnetic dipole moment, while a magnetic domain refers to a bulk region of collective spins or uniformly aligned spins. |
| **By default, it may be better to think of values in terms of ratios or slopes.** | A guiding principle in analyzing systems or problems: scaling relationships, slopes, and derivatives often reveal more insight than absolute numbers. |
| **Possible alternative name for microwave photon detector** | Microwave photon radiation detector. |
| **Everything is a transmission line, and everything is a capacitor (including self-capacitance).** | A broad conceptual notion in electronics and physics, emphasizing that all structures can be modeled as having transmission line properties and inherent capacitance. |

### Description of Spins & Spinors:

||
| - |
| Electron spins, including all spin 1/2 particles, are physical realizations, out of many, of the abstract, mathematical spinor representations in nature. Interestingly, this is one example where an abstract mathematical object has experimentally measurable effects or direct experimental consequences. Spins in the technical sense generally refer to the description of an intrinsic angular momentum, meaning that it is purely quantum mechanical. In mathematics and physics, a spinor* is a type of object used to describe particles with half-integer spin (spin -1/2, spin +1/2, etc.). These objects transform in a particular way under rotations (technically under the group SU(2), which is the double cover of the rotation group SO(3)). Here, a 2π rotation changes the phase of a spinor by −1, meaning it does not return to its original state but instead acquires a sign flip. <br> <br> In quantum theory, classifying all possible particle types comes down to looking at irreducible representations of the Poincaré group (in special relativity) or the Galilean group (in non relativistic mechanics). Spin 1/2 emerges naturally when you look at certain irreducible representations—namely, those described by spinors. Any spin- fermion—such as quarks, protons (composite, but effectively spin 1/2 in total), and neutrinos—can also be described by spinors or "spinor formalism". Additional note: the spin of protons arises from a complex interplay of quark spins, gluon angular momentum, and orbital motion. Its total spin behaves like a fundamental fermion, but its substructure is different from an elementary particle. |
| *Spinors are two-component objects, they do return to the same quantum state after a 4π rotation but not after 2π.|
| **Key terms**: irreducible representations, experimental consequences | 

### How to Generate a Pure Electric Field:

| **Method**               | **Mechanism** | **Key Considerations** | **Applications** |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Photoelectric Effect** | Light ejects electrons from a surface, creating charge imbalance | Requires photon energy > work function; works best in vacuum | Spacecraft charging, photoemission devices |
| **Controlled Charge Separation** | Electrons are emitted and collected on a secondary surface via photoemission, field emission, or thermionic emission | Requires an electron collector; prevents neutralization | Photoemission-based capacitors, charge storage |
| **Vacuum Conditions** | Electrons travel freely, leading to sustained electric fields | No surrounding medium to neutralize charge | Electron beam devices, vacuum tube applications |
| **Voltage Bias Application** | A potential difference guides photoelectrons to a specific region | Ensures continuous charge separation | Controlled electron beams, energy harvesting |
| **UV Radiation-Induced Charging** | High-energy UV photons eject electrons via the photoelectric effect | Effective in space or high-intensity UV environments | Spacecraft charging, UV-sensitive detectors |
| **Solar Wind Charging** | Plasma interactions induce surface charging and electron displacement | Occurs naturally in space; depends on plasma density and material properties | Spacecraft potential buildup, lunar dust levitation |
| **Photoemission Cathodes** | Use of a light-activated electron source in a circuit | Requires efficient cathode material | Photocathodes for electron guns, free-electron lasers |

### Cases of Quantized Light:   

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Photons** (Fundamental Quanta) | Discrete energy packets of the electromagnetic field; primary quanta of light in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum optics. | Spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, blackbody radiation, Compton scattering. |
| **Quantized Modes of the Electromagnetic Field** | The electromagnetic field can be described in terms of quantized oscillatory modes, even in the absence of real photons. | Vacuum fluctuations, zero-point energy, cavity QED, waveguide modes. |
| **Coherent & Squeezed States** | Special quantum states where light retains some classical properties but still exhibits quantum behavior. | Laser light (coherent states), squeezed vacuum states in quantum optics. |
| **Polaritons (Hybrid Quasiparticles)** | Light interacts with material excitations, forming mixed light-matter quasiparticles. | Exciton-polaritons (light + excitons in semiconductors), phonon-polaritons (light + lattice vibrations). |
| **Plasmons & Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs)** | Quantized collective oscillations of free electrons in a metal, coupled with the electromagnetic field. | Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), plasmonic waveguides, localized surface plasmons in nanoparticles. |

### Definition of Arbitrary & Arbitrary Units: 

| **Term**              | **Definition** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Arbitrary**       | Refers to chosen values or units that maintain internal consistency without relying on an external, standardized reference. Example: arbitrary units used in graphs and charts. |
| **Arbitrary Units (a.u.)** | Used in graphs and charts, they represent a consistent measure but do not correspond to a standardized physical unit. They are meaningful within the given context but are not directly comparable to a universal scale. |

### Key Differences of How Analytical Solutions are Defined & Used (Deterministic vs. Indeterministic): 

| **Deterministic Analytical Solutions** | **Indeterministic Analytical Solutions** |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**: A solution that, given the same initial conditions, **always produces the same result**. These solutions are fully **predictable** and **can be expressed in a closed mathematical form**. | **Definition**: A solution where the outcome is **probabilistic or dependent on unknown/uncontrollable factors**, even if the underlying equations are well-defined. |
| **Characteristics**: <br> - No randomness or probability involved. <br> - Given a set of initial conditions and equations, the result is always the same. <br> - Typically derived using exact algebraic, calculus-based, or differential equation methods. | **Characteristics**: <br> - **Involves probabilities or randomness** in the results. <br> - Repeating the same conditions **does not always yield the same outcome**. <br> - Often appears in **quantum mechanics, chaotic systems, and stochastic processes**. |
| **Examples**: <br> 1. **Newton’s Laws of Motion**: <br> - If you apply a known force to an object, its acceleration and trajectory can be determined exactly. <br> - Example: $( x(t) = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 )$ (kinematics equation). <br> <br> 2. **Ohm’s Law in Circuits**: <br> - $( V = IR )$ gives the exact voltage given current $( I )$ and resistance $( R )$. <br> <br> 3. **Schrödinger's Equation for Simple Systems**: <br> - The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom yields **exact energy eigenvalues** for electron states. | **Examples**: <br> 1. **Quantum Mechanics (Wavefunction Collapse)**: <br> - The Schrödinger equation **deterministically** evolves a wavefunction, but upon measurement, the outcome is probabilistic. <br> - Example: Measuring the spin of an electron in a superposition state gives a **random outcome** (e.g., 50% spin-up, 50% spin-down). <br> <br> 2. **Radioactive Decay**: <br> - The decay of a single nucleus follows a **probability distribution**, not a deterministic function. <br> - We can only predict **half-life**, but not when a specific atom will decay. <br> <br> 3. **Chaotic Systems (Butterfly Effect)**: <br> - Some classical systems, like **weather models**, follow deterministic equations but are **highly sensitive to initial conditions**, making long-term predictions effectively non-deterministic. <br> <br> 4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: <br> - Used in optimization and physics, these rely on **random sampling** to approximate solutions to complex problems. |
| **Summary**: <br> - **Deterministic solutions** provide exact answers **every time** for given conditions. | **Summary**: <br> - **Indeterministic (or non-deterministic) solutions** involve **probabilities** or **sensitive dependencies**, making exact results uncertain, even if the equations governing the system are known. |
